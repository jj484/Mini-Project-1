For this project, you need to explain how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company. 
Git:
Docker: software tool designed for creating and running applications in containers. Containers hold libraries and other resources and sends them out to users. It is important for a company to utilize Docker because any system, regardless of any customized settings, can write and test code through Docker as a loose form of virtualization. 
Automated testing:
continuous integration: a practice which describes the integration of code from users into a shared repository several times a day. In a company, because changes are being reported so often, issues can be caught and fixed quicker than if changes were made in a span of several hours. It builds a solid foundation of communication and teamwork within a team of workers.
