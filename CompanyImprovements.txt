For this project, you need to explain how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company. 
Git:The usage of git can greatly improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company by allowing users of git to manage software versions. This alone can help streamline development amongst many developers by allowing changes to be made concurrently and merged or discarded at a later date at the discresion of the manager of the repository. This overall would allow the company to reiterate on more ideas at the same time in order to find a solution to a problem faster than companies that do not use Git. 
Docker: software tool designed for creating and running applications in containers. Containers hold libraries and other resources and sends them out to users. It is important for a company to utilize Docker because any system, regardless of any customized settings, can write and test code through Docker as a loose form of virtualization. 
Automated testing: the usage of automated testing can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company by allowing the company to rapidly many scenarios much faster than manual testing. 
continuous integration: a practice which describes the integration of code from users into a shared repository several times a day. In a company, because changes are being reported so often, issues can be caught and fixed quicker than if changes were made in a span of several hours. It builds a solid foundation of communication and teamwork within a team of workers.
