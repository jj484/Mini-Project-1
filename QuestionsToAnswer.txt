Questions to answer: What is it? Why do you do it? How do you do it?

cd: change directory. Used for navigating your file system. 
  cd Documents/Work ---> moves you to the Documents directory, which then moves you to the Work directory.
mkdir: make directory. Creates folders for holding files directly from command line.
  mkdir New ---> creates a new directory called New in your current directory.
cp: copy. Copies files and directories while remaining independent of the original file.
  cp ThisFile.txt ThatFile.txt ---> copies the contents of ThisFile.txt to ThatFile.txt without changing ThisFile.txt.
pwd: print working directory. Displays the absolute path of the directory the user is currently in.
  pwd (example output): /Users/Adam/Documents/Work ---> shows the user where they are at in relation to the root (starting directory).
mv: move. Moves files and directories to another area of the system. Can overrite an existing file destination or create one if it doesn't exist.
  mv This.File.txt ThatFile.txt ---> if ThatFile.txt didn't already exist on the system, the command creates it. If it did already exist with different content from ThisFile.txt, it will be overwritten by the contents of ThisFile.txt.
rm: remove. Deletes files and directories from the system.
history: Displays history of all commands user has done.
Home directory and ~: Starting directories for systems. Helps manage separate files and directories.
file paths in linux: Navigation of the system. Absolute paths display your current directory from your root, and relative paths display your destination directory from your current directory.
Using the tab key to complete file paths: Autocomplete for files and directories. If the first three letters of a file or directory are typed in and do not match anything else in the directory, hitting tab will autocomplete the name of the file or directory.
Using up and down arrow for history: Navigation of all commands user has done. Shortcut for users who do not want to retype a certain command they have already done.
